  "summary": "REQ-13 appears implemented in TryDemoSection.tsx: the section wrapper uses a neutral background (bg-background) with flat borders, and green-accent-heavy styling is reduced via muted icon colors and muted panels. The demo URL/link target+rel behavior is preserved, and no gradients/glows are introduced. Two ancillary metadata/state files were also modified, which were not requested.",
