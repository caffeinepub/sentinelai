  "summary": "Branding was largely updated to “Nexus Forge AI” in several key UI components and the backend assistant was changed to return non-trapping, branded fallback answers with `healthy()` returning `true`. However, at least one explicit “SentinelAI” string remains in the frontend (Contact mailto destination), which likely violates the branding purge requirements and search-based acceptance criteria.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-33",
      "requirement": "Remove all user-facing occurrences of “SentinelAI” from the website UI/content so a case-insensitive search across `frontend/src` returns no matches in user-facing content.",
      "reason": "The diff still contains the string “SentinelAI” in frontend source, which would fail a repo-wide search check and risks rendering/exposing it (e.g., via mailto destination).",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/ContactSection.tsx (mailtoLink = `mailto:SentinelAI@usa.com?...`)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-35",
      "requirement": "Ensure the Contact section does not visually display “SentinelAI” anywhere (including visible email address and auto-generated subject/body text) while preserving the mailto destination behavior unless replaced.",
      "reason": "The Contact section constructs a `mailto:` URL containing `SentinelAI@usa.com`, leaving “SentinelAI” present in Contact section logic and potentially exposed to users; this also conflicts with the requirement to avoid visually displaying the string anywhere in the contact experience.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/ContactSection.tsx (mailtoLink = `mailto:SentinelAI@usa.com?subject=...&body=...`)"
      ]

    {
      "id": "REQ-36",
      "requirement": "Seed or persist a non-empty curated knowledge base on-canister and have `healthy()` return `true` when the knowledge base is usable.",
      "reason": "While a non-empty in-memory Map is seeded and `healthy()` returns `true`, the diff does not show any stable persistence or upgrade-safe storage for the knowledge base (no stable vars / migration shown). If persistence across upgrades is required, this is not evidenced in the diff summary.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo (content Map seeded, but no stable storage shown)"
      ]

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Broad UI/theme/SEO and non-requested section/content changes (e.g., “government-grade design tokens”, SEO metadata, content rewrites across multiple sections beyond the specified branding-removal targets).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focused on purging “SentinelAI” branding, updating SentinelAI-named asset references, Contact copy, and fixing backend assistant readiness. The diff summary indicates additional redesign/content/SEO work beyond what was requested.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (mentions index.css government-grade design tokens, tailwind theme changes, index.html SEO/OG updates, extensive section aesthetic/content changes)"
