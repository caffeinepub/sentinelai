  "summary": "Diff implements a minimal backend health query and a frontend banner-based reachability check, plus several frontend runtime hardening changes (scroll-to-section try/catch, defensive rendering, mailto form). However, the diff summary does not show any concrete changes addressing the stated deployment failure root cause, nor any audit/fix of missing static assets beyond referencing specific /assets/generated paths.",

      "id": "REQ-19",
      "requirement": "Identify and fix the root cause of the deployment failure so the project can build and deploy successfully end-to-end (frontend bundling + Motoko compilation; deploy succeeds; no new build-time warnings).",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows UI/runtime adjustments and a new health-check method, but does not include any build/deploy pipeline, configuration, dependency, or import/path fixes that would clearly resolve an end-to-end deployment failure. Without evidence of changes to build tooling/config or the failing area, this requirement is not demonstrably implemented.",

      "reason": "Multiple components reference specific generated asset paths, but the diff summary does not show any added/updated asset files under a public assets directory, nor any changes that ensure those referenced files exist. Therefore the asset audit/fix is not evidenced as completed.",
